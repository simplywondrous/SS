Drag and Drop

Okay so

We have ItemPage, which renders Drawers and we go down that hole

Drawer renders a draggable icon
  When click-and-hold, drawer becomes draggable
  All of drawer is switched with other Drawers
  Can identify drawer by ID


TODO:

- Set drag image as the whole drawer 
  - Hide current drawer image / collapse space

- OnDragUp isn't needed, so can move cursor logic down a level, from Body?

ISSUES:
  - So didn't manage to have cursor working as thought
    -"grab" will bring cursor back to middle of icon (which is fine)
    -"grabbing" does not show, instead it's pointer with square

  - Have not figured out how to drag the whole drawer element 
    while only enabling drag if the drag icon is clicked, 
    instead of clicking and dragging anywhere in the drawer
    - Current manual solution of making HTML element to Canvas
      - Alternative: html2canvas, domtoimage libraries
