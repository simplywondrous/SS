Drag and Drop

Okay so

We have ItemPage, which renders Drawers and we go down that hole

Drawer renders a draggable icon
  When click-and-hold, drawer becomes draggable
  All of drawer is switched with other Drawers
  Can identify drawer by ID


TODO:

- Set drag image as the whole drawer
  - Hide current drawer image / collapse space
